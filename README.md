# Zillow #HackHousing Hackathon: Seattle Housing Finder

The purpose of this app is to provide an example of how to best format an app submission on [Github](http://github.com) for a hackathon. If you'd like to suggest changes or improvements to this example, feel free to send me a pull request.
Goals:
•	Establish a direct connect between Landlords and future Section 8 tenants.
•	Create a user-friendly website that gives the Section 8 voucher holders the proper information needed to get them placed in a house, access to an emergency shelter, or an extension on their voucher deadline.
•	Display relative and updated information from provided datasets as well as directly from the landlords.

This application was developed February 6-8, 2015 for the [Zillow #HackHousing Hackathon](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack-housing-empowering-smarter-decisions-a-weekend-hackathon-registration-15310832111).

## Challenge and Approach

Our responds to [Challenge #2: Matching eligible tenants with accepting landlords is a perennial challenge – neither, it seems, has a central place to start looking for one another](http://zillow.mediaroom.com/download/Housing+Hackathon+-+Background.pdf%20).

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Research and understand the current challenges facing voucher holders and prospective landlords
- Develop and iterate strategies in correspondence with HUD and SHA resources in order to provide incentive for landlords to reach out to those in need of housing
- Provide strategies for implementing this new technology - educating voucher holders and landlords of its existence and ability to quickly fill vacancies
