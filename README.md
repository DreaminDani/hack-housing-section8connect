# Zillow #HackHousing Hackathon: Seattle Housing Finder

The purpose of this app is to provide an example of how to best format an app submission on [Github](http://github.com) for a hackathon. If you'd like to suggest changes or improvements to this example, feel free to send me a pull request.

This application was developed on February 5th, 2015 for the [Evergreen Awesome Hackthon](http://example.com/this-goes-nowhere).
